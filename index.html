<h1 id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The Government of Bangladesh is building its first nuclear power plant in Rooppur on the east side of the river Padma near Ishwardi in the Pabna district of Bangladesh.

    The project is being implemented by the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC), under the guidance of Science and Technology Ministry of the Government of Bangladesh. The nuclear power plant (NPP) will include two units, Rooppur Unit-1 and Rooppur Unit-2 with a capacity of 1.2GW each. </p>

<h1 id="npp">NPP PROJECT</h1>
<P>Building a nuclear power plant in the west of Bangladesh was first proposed in 1961. The Rooppur (or Ruppur) site in Pabna district about 160 km northwest of Dhaka was selected in 1963 and land was acquired. The government gave formal approval for a succession of plant proposals, then after independence a 125 MWe nuclear power plant proposal was approved in 1980, but not built.With growth in demand and grid capacity since then, a much larger plant looked feasible, and the government in 1999 expressed its firm commitment to build a plant at Rooppur. In 2001 it adopted the Nuclear Power Action Plan and in 2005 it signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with China.In 2007 the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) proposed two 500 MWe nuclear reactors for Rooppur by 2015, quoting likely costs of US$ 0.9-1.2 billion for a 600 MWe unit and $1.5-2.0 billion for 1000 MWe. In April 2008 the government reiterated its intention to work with China in building the Rooppur plant and China offered funding for the project. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved a technical assistance project for the Rooppur nuclear power plant to be initiated between 2009 and 2011, and it then appeared that a 1100 MWe plant was envisaged.<br>Russia, China and South Korea had all earlier offered financial and technical help to establish nuclear power in the country, and in March 2009 Russia made a formal proposal to build a nuclear power plant. In April 2009 the government approved the Russian proposal to build a 1000 MWe AES-92 nuclear plant at Rooppur for about $2 billion, and in May 2009 a bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement was signed by the two countries. A year later the proposal had expanded to include two such reactors by 2017.In May 2010 an intergovernmental agreement was signed with Russia, providing a legal basis for nuclear cooperation in areas such as siting, design, construction and operation of power and research nuclear reactors, water desalination plants, and elementary particle accelerators. Other areas covered included fuel supply and wastes.An agreement with Rosatom was signed in February 2011 for two 1000 MWe-class reactors to be built at Rooppur for the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC). Rooppur is close to a HVDC link with India and on the route of a planned 600 kV HVDC link running up the western side of the country.<br> Another intergovernmental agreement was signed in November 2011 for the project to be built by AtomStroyExport. In 2014 Moscow AEP said that the plant would be an AES-2006 with a version of its V-392M reactors, with Novovoronezh II being the reference plant. Turbine generators (high speed) are expected to be from Power Machines.A nuclear energy bill was introduced into parliament in May 2012, which outlined the establishment of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority. Parliament was told that 5000 MWe of nuclear capacity was envisaged by 2030, and that a second plant would be built in the south once Rooppur is operating.An intergovernmental agreement for provision of a $500 million Russian loan to finance engineering surveys on the site, project development and personnel training was signed in January 2013. The $500 million loan will be repaid in 12 years with five years' grace period. In June and October 2013, AtomStroyExport signed contracts with BAEC to prepare documentation related to the construction and environmental impact assessment for the Rooppur plant, as well as providing for necessary engineering studies, including site preparation and detailed design documentation. AtomStroyExport said that this represented a transition to long-term cooperation. Site works started in October 2013.A $190 million agreement for major site works to prepare for first concrete was signed in June 2014, and BAEC authorized this in September, to be completed by 2016.In February 2015 Orgenergostroy, a Russian company, won an $18 million tender to carry out an engineering survey, perform environmental monitoring and develop project documents for the plant. In December 2015 Russiaâ€™s InterRAO Engineering won a RUR 2.1 billion ($30 million) contract from Atomstroyexport for the concrete foundations.Site works were 80% complete in April 2016, and a site licence was issued by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority in June 2016. The project management company is JSC NIAEP, part of AtomStroyExport.<br>The main BAEC contract with AtomStroyExport signed in December 2015 amounts to $12.65 billion, including the first few years' fuel, with Russia financing 90% of the cost at an interest rate of Libor plus 1.75%, capped at 4%, repayable in 28 years with 10 years' grace period. In June 2016 the cabinet approved a draft agreement for Russia to provide an $11.38 billion credit facility for 90% of the project, and the agreement was signed in July. Bangladesh needs to pay its 10% of the contract value in advance. The Russian Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs and Bangladesh's state-owned Sonali Bank would work as authorized banks for the state credit.</P>
